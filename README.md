**I am a generalist software engineer and technical leader**, with almost a decade of experience building & delivering high quality, well-tested, and reliable software in a wide variety of domains, including the publicÂ sector, health & SaMD, fintech & banking, and retail.

I have been at **[ZÃ¼hlke](https://zuhlke.com)** in London since 2015. My consultancy projects there have included **mobile applications** in Swift and Kotlin, **backend servers** in Java and Kotlin, **Web apps** using Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript, and **developer tooling** in Python, Swift, and shell scripts.

I hold a **BSc with First Class Honours in Computer Science from Queen Mary, University of London** (2011-2015.)

My key interests are in **ethical and inclusive software design**, **fostering good engineering practice**, and **accessible digital interfaces for the public**. I think it is our moral duty as technologists to engage our social conscience when designing and building software, and work towards an inclusive, kinder industry and society.

Please use masculine pronouns (in English: he, him, his) when referring to me in the third person.
