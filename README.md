I am **Jonathan Rothwell BSc.**, a software engineer & architect, writer, & conference speaker. I am based in London in the United Kingdom.

I have a decade of experience building high quality software in the **publicÂ sector**, **health & SaMD**, **fintech**, and **retail** domains. Iâ€™m currently at [ZÃ¼hlke](https://zuhlke.com) where my projects include **mobile apps & SDKs** in Swift & Kotlin, **backends**, **Web**, and **developer tooling**.

I hold a **BSc with First Class Honours in Computer Science** from Queen Mary, University of London (2011-2015.)

My key interests are in **ethical and inclusive software design**, **safer systems**, and **accessible digital interfaces for the public**. I think it is our moral duty as technologists to engage our social conscience when designing and building software, and work towards an inclusive, kinder industry and society.

Please use masculine pronouns (in English: he, him, his) when referring to me in the third person.
